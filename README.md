# hw-06-weather-tracker

This is the homework for week six. If you type in any city, it will display the current weather on the "display" by pulling information from the weather API and displaying it as text content. It will also use the same method to display a five-day forecast of the same city. Then that very same city will be saved on local storage and put into a side section for "previosuly searched cities". These history searches are buttons that can be clicked in order to research the weather of an already searched city!
